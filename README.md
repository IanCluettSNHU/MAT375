# MAT375 - Mathematical Modeling
Comparing fixed percentage and carrying capacity models of the United States Population with eachother, and to actual Census Population data.

Not included in this repository is an excel file containing the US population data taken from Census population data.

Within the excel file, the population data is formatted as follows:
| 1950 | 1960 | ... | 2021 | 2022 |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| 158804.397 | 179323.175 | ... | 332915.074 | 334805.268 |

# Graphing Scripts:
These scripts output a graph comparing the respective model to real US population data.

# Percent Error Scripts:
These scripts create text files containing on each new row: 
- the real US population data for the given year
- the model's estimate for the given year
- the percent error between the model and real data

At the beginning of each file there are particular years singled out.
At the end of each file there is an output of the average error.
